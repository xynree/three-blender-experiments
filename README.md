# Three.js + Blender Exercises

A collection of Blender modeling exercises paired with Three.js visualizations, designed to build skills in 3D modeling, exporting, and interactive web rendering. Each exercise produces a GLB model that is displayed in a SvelteKit + Three.js environment. The final project combines all objects into a cohesive interactive **home studio / office scene**.
